                    Glorious Salvation Bible Church Inc. started in 1990 with a mandate to proclaim the gospel of Jesus Christ and to establish ministries and mission work that would be patterned after the New Testament model. </p>

                    <h2>üö© Our Core Values</h2>
                    <p>
                        We are deeply covenanted to the Lord God, to abide by His Holy Word, and our sole conviction is found in Acts 6:4, ‚ÄúBut we will give ourselves continually to prayer, and the ministry of the Word‚Äù.
                    </p>

                    <p>Therefore, It is our aspiration to seek holiness of character and live after the pattern of Christ and the teaching of the New Testament; recognising that it is on these that the Church was founded.</p>

                        <p>
                            The goal of the Church is to present the presence of person of Jesus Christ to change lives in our generation, to raise men and women who are accountable to God and to empower those are available or accessible for Him to use them practically in their various callings.

                            Our mission is to see this vision of Gods image passed back to man, and to build a strong family for a strong nation in the biblical pattern, under Glorious Salvation Bible Church Inc. <br> This is based on evangelism, revival meetings, conferences, seminars, retreats, etc

                            We believe God is calling us into this great task and giving us a mandate from heaven to evangelize this generation for Jesus Christ.  And so we pursue our vision with a strong vigour to establish Gods given vision as a church.

                        <h2>üí¢ Our Believe</h2>
                        <p>
                           We believe that the Church is a powerhouse for all Nations. And that it is the Church that fuels the Nation into righteousness because the scripture declares it in Proverb 14:34; Righteousness exalteth a Nation, but sin is a reproach to any people.

                    <p>
                        We also understand that there is a variety of expression of Church government and the life which seek to fulfill the goal of the church. The scripture also declares the various offices like the Apostle, Prophet, Evangelist, Pastor and Teacher required in establishing leadership positions to enhance easy flow in the function of the government in various ministries and church body.

                                Our Church is multi-congregational.  This means that even though we are one Church with one government, the Church is divided into local assemblies (branches).

                                These are the heart and strength of our church life, where a small group of members meet every week in different homes for mutual support, Bible study and prayer.  Due to their small sizes, cell Churches allow members to become better acquainted with one another.  They provide an opportunity for personal care and attention not afforded by larger church meetings.

                        <p>
                            There are many avenues of services tied to this group. We have a home and foreign missions projects and have retreats, and programmes where we meet with other Christian women to share fellowship as the Lord permits. Through the ministry, we encourage women to rise to the demands of their generation by stirring their callings into office in the ministry.
